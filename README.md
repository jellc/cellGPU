# CellGPU

CellGPU implements GPU-accelerated algorithms to simulate off-lattice models of cells. Its current
two main feature sets focus on a Voronoi-decomposition-based model of two-dimensional monolayers
and on a two-dimensional dynamical version of the vertex model. CellGPU grew out of DMS'
"DelGPU" and "VoroGuppy" projects, and the current class structure still bears some traces of that
(please see the contributing page of the documentation, which is maintained at
https://dmsussman.gitlab.io/cellGPUdocumentation
for information on upcoming code refactoring and new planned features). The paper describing this
code in more detail can currently be found on the arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02939), or in print (
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517301832)

Information on installing the project and contributing to it is contained in the relevant
markdown files in the base directory and in the doc/markdown directory. Documentation of the
code is maintained via Doxygen, which can be viewed at the gitlab.io pagea linked to above, or by compiling
the doxygen documentation in the "/doc" directory

A very rough outline of some of the main classes and the basic operating flow of the primary branches
of the code can be found [here](@ref basicinfo); this page is a good place to start before diving into
the code (Please note that if you are reading this on the Gitlab main page the links will not work...
visit the main documentation page at https://dmsussman.gitlab.io/cellGPUdocumentation or compile
Doxygen documentation locally).

By default cellGPU includes a few different classes, mostly using the netCDF format, for saving simulation
data. For convenience, a few Mathematica scripts demonstrating how to load these files and turn them
into simple visualizations are included in the visualizationTools directory -- these should be readily
portable to matlab, python, etc.
